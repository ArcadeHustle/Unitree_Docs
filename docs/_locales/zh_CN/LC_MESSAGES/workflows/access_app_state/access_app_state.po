"The **App State** is always up-to-date, even running an App in the cloud "
"on multiple machines. This means that every time an attribute is modified"
" in a Work, that information is automatically broadcasted to the Flow. "
"With this mechanism, any Component can **react** to any other Component's"
" **state changes** through the Flow and complex systems can be easily "
"implemented. Lightning requires a state based driven mindset when "
"implementing the Flow."

"As a user, you are interacting with your component attributes, so most "

"For example, here we define a **Flow** component and **Work** component, "

"state which contains the Work."
