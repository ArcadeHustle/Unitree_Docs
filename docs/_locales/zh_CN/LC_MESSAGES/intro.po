#: ../../intro.rst:9
msgid ""
"Lightning is a free, modular, distributed, and open-source framework for "
"building AI applications where the components you want to use interact "
"together."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:12
msgid ""
"Lightning apps can be built for **any AI use case**, ranging from AI "
"research to production-ready pipelines (and everything in between!)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:15
msgid ""
"By abstracting the engineering boilerplate, Lightning allows researchers,"
" data scientists, and software engineers to build highly-scalable, "
"production-ready AI apps using the tools and technologies of their "
"choice, regardless of their level of engineering expertise."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why Lightning?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:33
msgid "Easy to learn"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:35
msgid ""
"Lightning was built for creating AI apps, not for dev-ops. It offers an "
"intuitive, pythonic and highly composable interface that allows you to "
"focus on solving the problems that are important to you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:41
msgid "Quick to deliver"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:43
msgid ""
"Lightning speeds the development process by offering testable templates "
"you can build from, accelerating the process of moving from idea to "
"prototype and finally to market."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:49
msgid "Easy to scale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:51
msgid ""
"Lightning provides a mirrored experience locally and in the cloud. The "
"`lightning.ai <https://lightning.ai>`_. cloud platform abstracts the "
"infrastructure, so you can run your apps at any scale."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:57
msgid "Easy to collaborate"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:59
msgid ""
"Lightning was built for collaboration. By following the best MLOps "
"practices provided through our documentation and example use cases, you "
"can deploy state-of-the-art ML applications that are ready to be used by "
"teams of all sizes."

msgid "What's Novel With Lightning?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:71
msgid "Cloud Infra Made Simple and Pythonic"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:73
msgid ""
"Lightning is for building reactive, scalable, cost effective, easy-to-"
"maintain and reliable ML products in the cloud without worrying about "
"infrastructure. Lightning provides several engineering novelties to "
"enable this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:75
msgid ""
"**Reactivity**: Lightning allows you to run stateful components "
"distributed across different machines, so you can design async, dynamic "
"and reactive workflows in python, without having to define DAGs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:77
msgid ""
"**Scalable & Cost-Effective**: Lightning provides a granular and simple "
"way to run components preemptively or on-demand and on any desired "
"resource such as CPU or GPU. It also enables you to easily transfer "
"artifacts from one machine to another."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:79
msgid "**Reliability**:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:81
msgid ""
"**Checkpointing**: Lightning apps can be paused and resumed from "
"generated state and artifact-based checkpoints."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:82
msgid ""
"**Resilience**: Lightning has a strong fault-tolerance foundation. Your "
"application can be written and tested to be resilient for cloud hazards "
"at the component level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:83
msgid ""
"**Testing Tools**: Lightning provides you with tools and best practices "
"you can use to develop and test your application. All of our built-in "
"templates have unit integration and end-to-end tests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:85
msgid "**Easy to maintain**:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:87
msgid ""
"**Easy Debugging**: Lightning apps can be debugged locally and in the "
"cloud with **breakpoints** in any components."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:88
msgid ""
"**Non-Invasive**: Lightning is the glue that connects all parts of your "
"workflow, but this is done in a non-invasive way by formalizing API "
"contracts between components. In other words, your application can run "
"someone else's code with little assumption."
