"Traditionally, developing machine learning (ML) products requires "
"choosing among a large space of hyperparameters while creating and "
"training the ML models. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to find a "
"well-performing hyperparameter configuration for a given ML model on a "
"dataset at hand, including the ML model, its hyperparameters, and other "
"data processing steps."
