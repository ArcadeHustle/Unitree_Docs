"Lightning Drives are shared app storage that allow you to share files "
"between `LightningWork (Work) "
"<../../core_api/lightning_work/index.html>`_ components, so that you "
"distributed components can share files when running on the cloud. Using "
"drives, you can run your Lightning App both locally and in the cloud "
