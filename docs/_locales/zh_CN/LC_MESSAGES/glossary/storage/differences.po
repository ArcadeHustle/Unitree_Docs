"The Lightning Storage system makes it easy to share files between "
"LightningWork so you can run your app both locally and in the cloud "
"without changing the code."

"Lightning storage provides two solutions "
":class:`~lightning_app.storage.drive.Drive` and "
":class:`~lightning_app.storage.path.Path` to deal with files locally and "
"in the cloud likewise."

"The Drive object provides a central place for your components to share "
"data."

msgid ""
"The drive acts as an isolate folder and any component can access it by "
"knowing its name."

"Your components can put, list, get, delete files from and to the Drive "
"(except LightningFlow's)."

msgid "What is a Path ?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../glossary/storage/differences.rst:34
msgid ""
"The Path object is a reference to a specific file or directory from a "
"LightningWork and can be used to transfer those files to another "
"LightningWork (one way, from source to destination)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../glossary/storage/differences.rst:36
msgid ""
"A good mental representation of the Path Object usage is the `relay race "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race>`_. To make a transfer, the "
"LightningWork Receiver asks (e.g when the path object is passed by the "
"flow to the Receiver) for a copy of the files (baton) owned by their "
"LightningWork Producer (e.g the work that created the files)."

msgid "When should I use Drive vs Path ?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../glossary/storage/differences.rst:46
msgid ""
"The Drive should be used when you want to easily share data between "
"components but the Path enables to create cleaner shareable component "
"where you want to exposes some files to be transferred (like an HPO "
"component sharing the best model weights) for anyone else to use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../glossary/storage/differences.rst:49
msgid ""
"The Drive is more intuitive and easier to get on-boarded with, but in "
"more advanced use cases, you might appreciate the Path Object which makes"
" uni-directional files transfer simpler."
