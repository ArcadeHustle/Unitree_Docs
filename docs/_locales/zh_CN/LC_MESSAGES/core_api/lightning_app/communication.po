"When creating interactive Lightning Apps (App) with multiple components, "
"you may need your components to share information with each other and "
"rely on that information to control their execution, share progress in "
"the UI, trigger a sequence of operations, etc."

"To accomplish that, Lightning components can communicate using the App "
"State. The App State is composed of all attributes defined within each "
"component's **__init__** method e.g anything attached to the component "
"with **self.x = y**."

"Once a Work is running, any updates to the Work's state is automatically "
"communicated to the Flow, as a delta (using `DeepDiff "
"<https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff>`_). The state communication isn't "
"bi-directional, communication is only done from Work to Flow."
