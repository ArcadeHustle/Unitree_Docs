"A Lightning component is a self-contained, modular machine-learning "
"component that you can plug into your existing ML workflows. A Lightning "
"component organizes arbitrary code so it can run on the cloud, manages "
"its own infrastructure, cloud costs, networking and more. Connect "
"components using your current workflow management tools or our `next-"
"generation reactive orchestrator <../intermediate/index.html>`_."

"Lightning embeds the best practices of building production-ready full "

"if you know what you are doing, Lightning gives you full control to "
